# Step 3 - Add State Actions to the React Application

Copy over your `React` code from Step 2 into this project. From there, let's add a `Like` counter to our page! It should start with a value of 15, meaning our page already has 15 likes! From there, add a button next to the `Like` counter that will like, and unlike, the page. This should increment or decrement the counter accordingly. And example image is attached.
